# A Picture Grid Screensaver for Kodi
This is a [Kodi](http://kodi.tv) screensaver addon for Kodi 19 Matrix.

## Motivation
Inspiration comes from the Multi Slideshow Screensaver created by sphere. See [the relevant thread on kodi forum](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=173734).

 I loved the GridSwitch effect in which I could display randomly my video fanarts in a 3x3 grid. Unfortunately, this addon doesn't work anymore on Kodi 19 Matrix.
 
 So, it was a great opportunity for me to learn how to create a simple addon.
 
## Credits
* Thanks to Zag and its [screensaver example](https://github.com/zag2me/script.screensaver.example)

* And thanks to Ronie and its [screensaver.picture.slideshow](https://gitlab.com/ronie/screensaver.picture.slideshow) from which I learnt a lot a re-used some code.

## Installation
You can either download the latest release as a zip, then install it with `Settings>Addons>Install from ip File`

Or you can copy the folder to your kodi installation. On Linux, it's `./kodi/addons`

This was tested only on Linux and Android.

## Final Words
* This is a hobby WIP project. Main goals are to learn kodi programming and to display my holliday pictures in a cool way. 
* ~~Exif orientation is ignored for now.
(implemented in v1.0.6)
* I have some random slowdowns when used on my Video Fanarts collection, but I didn't spot the culprit yet.
