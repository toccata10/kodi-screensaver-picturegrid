v1.0.3
- added an option to randomly switch the display grid after a few pictures
- added an option to display some comments on the picture. Comments have to be in a
file named "commentaires.csv" located in the same folder as pictures. The format is:
        relative_file_name, written comment.
    Example:
        IMG_20140823_113529.jpg, my wonderful comment
This is a workaround for Google Photos not saving comments in the picture's exif
but in a database (which can be converted to a csv file with the appropriate tool)

v1.0.2
- initial public release
